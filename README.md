# Deep-Learning-Challenge

I had initial accuracy of nural network model of about 74%. With some google i got that you could increase number of nurons to increase accuracy. changed layer1 unit from 8 10 10, layer 2 units from 5 to 8. tried changing activation method for layer3 from relu to sigmoid. still same result with slight variation.
